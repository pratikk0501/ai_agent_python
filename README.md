# ai-agent-python
* This project is titled 'Building an AI Agent in Python' in which a CLI tool was made that could operate on local directories and files using predefined functions.
# Project Description
* Developed a command-line AI coding assistant inspired by Claude Code, leveraging Googleâ€™s free Gemini LLM API to autonomously analyze and modify codebases.
* Implemented agent functionality to scan directories, read and overwrite files, and execute Python scripts in a loop until coding tasks were resolved.
* It performed those operations using already defined functions from user end on the files and folders in the project directory.
